Best Of Northern Italy
====

If you want to see the best of Northern Italy you should strongly think about seeing the following major locations:

 * Milan - shopping, modern culture, various historic sites
 * Cinque Terre - absolute must see, these are stunning small towns with laid back Italian environs
 * Florence - The crown jewel of the Italian Renaissance
 * Venice - if you haven't heard of this you don't deserve to be traveling

In addition to these primary location there are also some nice to see places near the Italian alps, and the lake towns of northern Italy. These are optional locations to see but could be integrated easily into any trip given sufficient time. The rest of this document lays out each of these locations in an expected order and lists some of the costs and other logistics involved in staying in these locations.

Credit: most of this information is gathered from Rick Steve's "Italy 2017" guide book, the Lonely Planet "Best of Europe" combined with details from various travel sites and blogs. For more detail on any site page numbers in these books or links are referenced.

### Milan

Simply put this is a great place to start and presents a few interesting sites but it isn't worth a great deal of time investment. This is the second largest city in Italy - but unlike Rome, this is more of a shopping and fashion city. More industrious, but it does have the flavors of Italy and it does have some interesting sites as well. Rick Steve's doesn't particularly recommend this it as much since it is more of a business city. Maximum recommended stay is two nights.

The following are some of the "must know" costs for Milan as of 4/15/2018. All costs are per person:

|Incidental|Approximate Cost|
|----------|----------------|
|Airfair (one way)|$845+ via CMH|
|Airfair (roundtrip)|$1118+ via CMH|
|Hotel Bernina|$65/night|
|Hotel Star|$220/night|
|Coffee/Latte|4€|
|Breakfast Pastery|2€|
|Sit Down Restaurant|20 - 40€|
|Take Out|7€|
|Gelato/Dessert|~4€|

The following are the main attractions and hours for those attractions in Milan:

|Attraction|Approximate Cost|Hours|Notes (what you'll see)|
|----------|----------------|-----|-----------------------|
|Main opera house|7€|Open daily 09:00 - 12:30, 13:30 - 17:30|Architecture and museum|
|The last supper|15.5€|Reservations required. Tues - Sun 8:15 - 18:45|Davinci's painting|
|Main cathedral ("Duomo")|10 - 15€|Daily 08:00 - 19:00. Church is closed Wed.|Museum, rooftop terraces, church|

Note that there are quite a few other attractions and museums in the city, but these are the primary ones that you'll want to see. Hightlights can be found on p.270 of "Rick Steves Italy". The following are options for leaving Milan and heading to your next destination - the Cinque Terre:

 * Euro [rail pass](http://www.railpass.com/) is $512 for 4 days of travel in a month. Seems overpriced, still requires train reservations.
 * Reserving [online](https://www.italiarail.com/) is $20 - 40 / person and will take approximately 3 hrs. Can be reserved 45 days or so in advance. Likely requires a train switch in La Spezia station.

### Cinque Terre

The Cinque terre represents five distinct cities that have walking trails in between each of them. Some of these trails may or may not be closed. All of them require a park pass 7.50€ / person obtainable [here](https://card.parconazionale5terre.it/en/). The following is a short description of each city as pulled from Rick Steve's guide p318 (arranged from South to North):

 * Riomaggiore - The most "workday" of the five towns
 * Manarola - Low-key, hiking focused picturesque town
 * Corniglia - Quiet hilltop village with a tradition of fine wines
 * Vernazza - The regions gem, crowned with a ruined castle and lively waterfront
 * Monterosso al Mare - The most resorty, flat spred out town. Best beaches, swimming and night life

Recommended a minimum of two nights in this area. Trying to spend less time will rush it and result in not getting your money's worth. Based on various guides, August is oppressively hot and not much is open. Monday's are also a bad day to see sites here. The next five sections are a bit more detail and notes on each of the towns.

Generally, no matter where you are at in the Cinque Terre the following should be helpful:

 * Ferry Information per [this site](https://cinqueterreinsider.com/2018/03/22/cinque-terre-ferry-schedules-2018/): Full day ticket with on/off privilidges is 25€ / person. Round trip tickets to a single destination start at 7€. One way point to point tickets start at 5€. Cash only.
 * Train information per [this site](http://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-card): Cinque Terre train tickets are 16€ / person for a one day pass and 29€ for a two day pass. Includes on/off privilidges. Trains run every 30 minutes. Validate ticket at the station prior to boarding the train. Purchase the tickets at a TI in any town [see here](http://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-tourist-information-points). Rick Steve's Italy p322 indicates that tickets might be 10€ per day if purchased at the correct location.
 * Hiking maps: These can be found online [here](https://www.wanderingitaly.com/a/cinque_terre_hiking_trails.htm). There is a slightly more detailed version that can be found [here](http://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/images/stories/images-maps/cinque-terre-sentieri-big.jpg). Also a simple map on p328/329 of Rick Steve's Italy. Note that all of the articles tend to be very wordy, but they essentially recommend that you should hike. Yup, thats what they say. Wear/bring good shoes, water and other simple gear. Point to point the longest hike is approximately 7 miles but is over hilly terrain.

When leaving the Cinque Terre to go to Florence, the next stop, you'll probably be looking at the following approximate costs and times:

 * Italy Rail - Cheapest tickets from Riomaggiore to Florence are $21 and take approximately 3 hours to make the journey. Requires one connection in "La Spezia Centrale". Once again train tickets can be reserved and paid for in advance online. 


#### Cinque Terre: Riomaggiore

More of a "workday" town, but still definitely worth a visit. Has a nice towny hike in the guide book and a small rocky but peaceful beach. The following are a few notes:

|Incidental|Approximate Cost|
|----------|----------------|
|Air BnB|$102 - 165/night|
|Hotels|$120 - 190/night|
|Dinner|$15 - 30/person|

Recommended breakfast by Rick Steves is the Bar Centrale or Giammi Cafe. Trip advisor also recommends [Cafe Matteo](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187818-d1111564-Reviews-Caffe_Matteo-Corniglia_Cinque_Terre_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html) for breakfast.

#### Cinque Terre: Manarola

Manarola is a balance between the various elements expected in a Cinque Terre town (hiking, atmosphere, crowds, etc). Has the easiest access to the Cinque Terre's dry-stone terraces. No beach per-se, but does have the best deep water swimming in the area. A few additional notes:

|Incidental|Approximate Cost|
|----------|----------------|
|Air BnB|$85 - 160/night|
|Hotels|$150 - 220/night|

Trattoria dal Billy is highly recommended by Rick Steves and he suggests that reservations are a must. 

#### Cinque Terre: Corniglia

Not actually on the water this town is higher in elevation and is therefore a bit windy and cooler. A bit of shopping is available and some small restaurants as well. A few approximate costs:

|Incidental|Approximate Cost|
|----------|----------------|
|Air BnB|$85 - 200/night|
|Hotels|N/A|


#### Cinque Terre: Vernazza

This is in some ways the best of the Cinque Terre, in terms of history and environs. Map of Vernazza on p650 of "Best of Europe" shows a number of Cafe's, Gelaterias and a Wine experience. On Tuesday mornings there is an open air market. Main thing to do besides that is still essentially hiking and enjoying the beach/harbor. Again approximate costs:

|Incidental|Approximate Cost|
|----------|----------------|
|Air BnB|$100 - 250/night|
|Hotels|$150 - 220/night|
|Castello Doria|Required donation 1.5€. Cash only|
|Dinner|15 - 21€ / person|

A bit more expensive, but concievably worth it to be in the heart of the Cinque Terre (Air BnB shows Avg price as $158/night). 

#### Cinque Terre: Monterosso al Mare

This is a beautiful small resort town on the coast. More to do late at night, but still not at "glitzy" as the riviera (Genoa, etc). The only Cinque Terre town built on flat land. There are a couple of interesting churches to see, a hilltop cemetery, beaches, boat rides, wine tasting and a few bars ("nightlife"). The following are approximate costs:

|Incidental|Approximate Cost|
|----------|----------------|
|Air BnB|$155 - 300/night|
|Hotels|$250+ /night|

Based on the search dates (the end of August for valid comparisons), there were very few actual availabilities. Likely selecting a different date range would lower the prices at least somewhat. This definitely was the most expensive of the five cities, though it is also the largest in terms of restaurants, etc. (Air BnB avg cost was $206/night).

### Florence

This is a hot bed for the Italian renaissance - Michelangelo's David, and the Uffizi Gallery as quick examples. Really, this city is chock full of historic sites. The following are some things worth noting about Florence:
