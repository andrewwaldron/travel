## General

No masks required except on public transportation or as required by individual shop owners (see individual stores for details.)

WHAT SHOULD I WEAR FOR RESORT ACTIVITIES?
At 9,000 feet, exposure to the sun is 40% greater than it is at sea level. We recommend bringing along sun protection, including sunscreen, hats and sunglasses, as well as a reusable water bottle. Afternoon thunderstorms are common in the mountains and may cause interruptions and delays in summer activities and lift operations. Lifts and activities may close on occasion due to weather conditions, causing delays. Bring a raincoat and be sure to pack a sweater and other extra layers. Keep in mind that many activities are active, so wear clothes that are easy to move around in.  Learn more about packing for your Breckenridge summer vacation.

| ----------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Hiking | No limits | Tips for hiking with kids can be found [here](https://gobreck.com/trip-ideas/family-friendly/tips-for-hiking-with-kids/). There is a great guide to easy/moderate hiking [here](https://gobreck.com/trip-ideas/hiking/easy-hiking-trails-in-breckenridge/). For full map of trails see the PDF in the folder. Note that it is recommended to get an early start on the day due to higher than usual traffic, especially on weekends due to COVID. Should be better during our dates but still worth noting.   |
| Daily Events | See [link](https://gobreck.com/experience-breckenridge/festivals-and-events/breckenridge-community-events/#start_date=2021-08-25) | There are small time things to go see every day.

For more information and tickets see [here](https://tickets.breckcreate.org/Online/default.asp) |
| Blue lakes trail (hike) | Any | This short hike offers waterfall views and a high alpine lake after a short hike.  The trail continues for those interested in a more strenuous hike. *Distance*: Viewing walk of waterfall and high alpine lakes is .05 mile walk on the dam *Directions*:  Drive south on Main St./Hwy 9 out of Breckenridge for 8 miles until you reach Blue Lakes Road/No. 850 on your right. Turn onto Blue Lakes Road/No. 850 and at the fork go straight for 2 miles on a rough dirt road. Parking is available where the road dead-ends at the dam at Upper Blue Lake. At the dam, there is a waterfall and possibility of mountain goats. |
| Sapphire Point (hike) | Any | At a distance of about a mile and a half, Sapphire Point is an easy, fun and short hiking loop that offers unparalleled views of Summit County and Lake Dillon. Itâ€™s one of the excellent easy hiking trails in Breckenridge for families with small children or older relatives. *Distance*: 1.6 miles round trip *Elevation Gain*: None *Directions*: From the intersection of Main Street and Ski Hill Road/Lincoln Avenue drive north on Highway 9 approximately 5 miles to Swan Mountain Road. Turn right on Swan Mountain Road and drive for about 3 miles until you reach the top of the road. The trailhead is on the left side of the parking lot. |
| Biking | Various | Generally if you want to rent bikes and do your own thing you can. You can find lots of rental places online but I found [Alpine Sports](https://alpinesportsrental.com/summer-rentals/) Seemed to have a nice variety of bikes and trailers. There are nice flat trails for biking and you can rent for a few days if you don't know when you are going to want to use the cycle but just want to wait and see. Note That Online Reservations must be made a *minimum of 48 hours in advance*. If you need equipment sooner, please call our store. They also have E-Bikes you want to ride but don't feel like stressing out! Another place to rent is Christy Sports [here](https://easyresv3.wintersteiger.at/index_easyrent.php?shopid=100696&branchid=16). Bike map of breck is in the folder as well. |
| Biking: Around lake dillon | Any | 18 miles around the lake. 31 miles round trip from Breckenridge. This 18-mile, 1,100' climb ride has one significant climb and descent over Swan Mountain on the south side of the lake. Note that the directions below are for a clockwise trip around the lake. Once at the top at the Sapphire Point parking area, a walking path takes you to a spectacular view at Sapphire point. For more information see [here](http://www.summitbiking.org/area_rides/around_lake_dillon.html) |
| Biking: Breck to Frisco | Any | Easy 20-mile ride on the Summit County Rec Path between Breck & Frisco. This is a good 17-mile out & back ride for kids because other than one short relatively steep hill south of the hospital, the trail is a very gentle grade downhill to Frisco (and uphill on the return!). The trail can be very busy with other bikers, inline skaters, and hikers so use caution. Many folks think it is a flat ride to Frisco and get fooled by the gradual but steady climb back to Breckenridge, often after a big lunch! For more information see [here](http://www.summitbiking.org/area_rides/breckfrisco.html) |
