# Travel

This is basically just a simple repo meant to contain jots and scribbles around possible trips that I may or may not eventually take. In the past I was more disorganized so hopefully this will help and will also enable sharing more easily. Please feel free to open a pull request if something is incorrect or needs clarification.
